			<font face="bell mt" size="2">Tower of God had no shortage of action; this week, the characters face the consequences. “Beyond the Sadness” is a bookend episode, resolving last week's occurrences and setting up some worldbuilding for the future without much high stakes activity in between. As we gear up for the season finale, all the characters are making their preparations: Khun is scheming, Serena is saying goodbye, and Bam is figuring out what he wants to do next. Some characters are clearly less in the dark about future events than others and their behind-the-scenes intrigue doesn't make a lot of sense right now.</font><br><img src="th.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="100"><font face="engravers mt" size="2"><u>Orange's Leviathan Alternate-History Anime Series</u></font><hr>
